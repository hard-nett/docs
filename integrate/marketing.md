## Marketing Opportunities

### Co-sponsored Twitter Competition

An art competition, such as a Meme creation competition run on Twitter is a great way to get people excited about a project and to help spread awareness by requiring tagging, sharing, and/or retweeting as part of the qualification requirements. Historically, these have been meme-competitions (who can make the funniest memes?), but it could also be serious art, or, really, anything else.

TerpNet Ministry of Marketing Sponsorship Amounts:
- 1st place: 69 TERP
- 2nd place: 20 TERP
- 3rd place: 4 TERP

Sponsoring Project Amounts:
- Can be virtually any amount, but should at least be worth the OMM Sponsorship amounts.
- Should have an amount for 1st, 2nd, 3rd place winners
