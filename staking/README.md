# Delegate Tokens To A Validator

In the view of TERPNET's **Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS)** consensus protocol, the network will consist of numerous validators that require CHT tokens to run nodes, while other CHT token holders can be delegators by staking their tokens to validators and get shared rewards for each newly created block.

Over the course of using **TERPNETChain**, CHT token holders can start delegating CHT tokens to any qualified validators on the TERPNET.

**Reminder:** Prior to the delegation, make sure that you’ve already got an TERPNET account in keplr as well as sufficient CHT tokens.

**Step 1:** Visit [**https://stake-terpnet.zenchainlabs.io/**](https://stake-terpnet.zenchainlabs.io/) and log into your account via **Connect Wallet**.

**Step 2:** Navigate to the **Stake** section, in which you can see a list of validators assigned by TerpNetwork.


**Step 3:** Enter a certain number of Test CHT tokens and confirm your delegation.


**Step 4:** A prompt of Keplr will pop up on the screen > Click **Allow** to **Sign Transaction**

Once done, you’ll be redirected to the **Transaction Details**
