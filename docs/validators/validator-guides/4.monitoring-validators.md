# Monitoring validators

There is a <a href="https://grafana.com/" target="_blank" >Grafana</a> dashboard that is compatible with all the <a href="https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk" target="_blank" >cosmos-sdk</a> and <a href="https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint" target="_blank" >tendermint</a> based blockchains.


Let's set it up for our network.

## Prerequisites

First install <a href="https://grafana.com/" target="_blank" >Grafana</a> and <a href="https://prometheus.io/" target="_blank" >Prometheus</a> on your machine.

## Enable tendermint metrics

You will need to edit the node's `config/config.toml` file, setting `prometheus` to `true`:


```bash
sed -i 's/prometheus = false/prometheus = true/g' \ 
<YOUR-NODE-HOMEDIR>/config/config.toml
```

In order for the change to take effect you will need to restart the node. You should be able to access the `tendermint` metrics which defaults to port **26660**: <http://localhost:26660>

## Configure prometheus targets

Find `prometheus.yml` file and append the following `job` under the `scrape_configs`:

:::info 
On linux machines this file can be found under this path: `/etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml`
#
::: 


```yaml
- job_name: terp
  static_configs:
    - targets: ['localhost:26660']
      labels:
        instance: validator
```

## Resolving port conflicts
When both **terpd** and **prometheus** are running on the same machine, one of the service will encounter a port conflict, causing it to be unable to execute. Do the following to resolve this issue.

Open the node's **config/app.toml** file and look for:

```toml
[grpc]
address = "0.0.0.0:9090"
```

Change the port to something else:

```toml
[grpc]
address = "0.0.0.0:9095"
```
## Restart prometheus and terpd

Restart **terpd** using the followng:



```bash
sudo systemctl stop terpd
sudo systemctl start terpd
```


The you can restart **prometheus**:

```bash
sudo service prometheus restart
```

## Adding a prometheus service file (Optional)

A service file can be used to allow for the automatic restart of the service, helping to make sure that your node is always monitored.

You can create a service file with:


```bash
nano /etc/systemd/system/prometheus_s.service

```
Add the following content to the file:


```service
[Unit]
Description=Prometheus
Wants=network-online.target
After=network-online.target
[Service]
User=$USER
Type=simple
ExecStart=/home/$USER/prometheus/prometheus \
--config.file /home/$USER/prometheus/prometheus.yml \
--storage.tsdb.path /home/$USER/prometheus/ \
--web.console.templates=/home/$USER/prometheus/consoles \
--web.console.libraries=/home/$USER/prometheus/console_libraries
Restart=always
RestartSec=3
LimitNOFILE=4096
[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target

```

You can then reload the **systemctl** daemon:

```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
```
