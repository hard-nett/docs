This guide shows how to set up a node, run that node and create your validator.

You will need to use the Networks page to find information like the `<chain-id>` and `<rpc-url>` of the network you would like to connect to.

It is recommended to run the node using Cosmovisor, as this is the current best practice to run a validator.

## Running your validator

The first step is to run a node. See the [Node Installation](../nodes/installation) and [Joining a Network](../join-a-network/overview) guides for instructions on how to get your node up and running.

Make sure to [initialize your node](../nodes/initialize) and [add your keys](../nodes/keys).

After your node is running and synced, you can create a validator by staking tokens.


## Run a validator post-genesis

### **Retrieve the genesis file**
To retrieve the genesis file, install [jq](https://jqlang.github.io/jq/download/) (lightweight and flexible command-line JSON processor). Run the below command to retrive the genesis file:

```
curl -s "<rpc-url>/genesis" | jq '.result.genesis' > ~/.terp/config/genesis.json
```
This will replace the default genesis file with the one connected to the network you are joining.

After having followed the [instructions to join a network](../join-a-network/overview) and your running node is synced, you can create a validator by executing the `create-validator` command. Please make sure to create a validator only once the node is fully synced, so that you avoid being slashed.

Now, you can take a look at the following example to create your validator:

<Container>
<Tabs>
<TabItem value="binary" label="Binary">

```bash
terpd tx staking create-validator \ 
--from <my-validator-account> \ 
--amount 1000000uterp \ 
--min-self-delegation 1000000 \
--commission-rate 0.01 \ 
--commission-max-rate 0.1 \
--commission-max-change-rate 0.01 \
--pubkey "$(terpd tendermint show-validator)" \
--chain-id <chain-id> \
--gas-adjustment 1.3 \
--gas auto \
--fees 30000uthiol
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="docker" label="Docker">

```bash
docker run --rm -it -v ~/.terp:/root/.terp terpnetwork/terpd:barberry tx staking create-validator --from <my-validator-account> --amount 1000000000udenom --min-self-delegation 1000000000udenom --commission-rate 0.01 --commission-max-rate 0.1 --commission-max-change-rate 0.1 --pubkey "$(terpd tendermint show-validator)" --chain-id chain-id> --gas-adjustment 1.3 --gas auto --fees 30000uthiol
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>
</Container>


## Next steps

Great! Now, make sure you [monitor your validator](./) Monitoring the validator will help to prevent getting slashed, and ensure higher reliability to your validating operations.
