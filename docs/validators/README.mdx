## What are nodes?

A node is a program that can verify and share transactions and blocks on a blockchain. Almost all nodes help the network by accepting transactions and blocks from other nodes, and relaying them to further nodes.

### Types of Nodes
- **Validator:** validates blocks and transactions in the network.
- **Seed Node:** shares info about nodes in the network, to newly connecting nodes.
- **Archive Node:** contains the entire state of the network.
- **Sentry Node:** prevents desired nodes ip information from being shared with the rest of the network.


### Who Runs Nodes?
Many people and organizations volunteer to run full nodes using spare computing and bandwidth resourcesâ€”but more volunteers are needed to allow Terp Network to continue to grow.
