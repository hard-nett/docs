# Terp Network 
 **Terp Network** is an CosmWasm & IBC Layer One Network in the Cosmos Ecosystem.

 Terp Network allows for powerful smart contract logic to be censorship resistant & publicly verifiable, to enhance the cannabis culture.  This allows teams and developers
 to have all the desired functions of other largely adopted smart contract frameworks, in the verifiable method blockchains using consensus methods like CometBFT & Tendermint provide.

 ## Terp DAO


 **Terp DAO** is the community-led & organized decentralized organization dedicated with aligned goals of Terp Network to continue to build the Terp Network ecoysystem. 

 The DAO is currently operating on DAO-DAO, & efforts for both the DAO constitution & on-chain migration are being put in place.

 The **Terp Network Governance Framework** is still a work-in-progress, and will be rolled out in a modular fashion. The Framework is likely to change & evolve as the network matrures and grows. This document repository will be updated to the best of our ability to remain up-to-date.
