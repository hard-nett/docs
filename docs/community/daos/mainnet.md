Introduction to Terp Network DAO's

Currently, a Dao of members volunteering to contributions exist on Juno Network. These plans help us map out the next steps moving forward to ensure we can maximize the next steps, while aiming to minimize individual contributors risk as much as possible.
### A - Root-DAO
The Root-DAO is the final layer of consensus for Treasury actions and TerpNET Foundation managerial actions. With a pledge to progressively decentralize, the Root-DAO is committed to achieving a minimum of 2x consensus involvement in the CoreDAO by Q1 2024 and onboarding a non-profit by the same time. This DAO will serve as the cornerstone of our decentralized network, ensuring that the interests of our community are well represented.
### B - Validation-SubDAO 
The Validation-SubDAO is initially comprised of validators participating in the Main Network Genesis. These validators have pledged to keep the network secure during its initial infancy and growth by maintaining uptime reliability and adopting slashing-resistant practices.
### C - App-Integration-SubDAO
The App-Integration-SubDAO is focused on development and is comprised of contributors with skillsets in permissionless web application engineering or team leadership roles. This sub-DAO serves as the focal point for funding logic integration into various projects the Foundation is participating in.
### D - Design-SubDAO
The Design-SubDAO is open to all creative direction growth leaders and serves as a platform for appointing management and funding design projects. Whether you're a seasoned designer or just starting out, this sub-DAO provides an opportunity for you to evolve the platform our DAO can become for all artists & creators.

Every time a new subdao is instantiated, it should always have a documentation link provided within the creation proposal similar to this one, communicating thoroughly on the intentions, roles & MVPS of involvement.
