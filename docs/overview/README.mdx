# About Terp Network

Terp Network is a blockchain protocol built for ownership by community members of the cannabis culture. 

The protocol provides its users and developers with the tools to build & launch scalable, hyperfocused dapps and recieve rewards for the value that the dApps contribute to the network.

# The Terp Mission

The broad goal of Terp Network is to foster innovation & adoption of sovereign applications that empower and reward cannabis community members for participating in the network. 

The last 10 years has included a dramatic shift in the landscape of cannabis industries. The mission of Terp Network is to ensure that the pioneering cannabis communities continue to have undoubtable access & sovereignty to shaping how we collaborate with each other in a techological world.



# Architectural Overview

Terp Network is a Cosmos SDK blockchain powered by Comet-BFT for the networking and consensus layers. The network utilizes modified Cosmos modules to manage various functions, including:

- **Minting** - Responsible for minting tokens and managing inflation.
- **CosmWasm** - A runtime for WebAssembly Smart Contracts.
- **Staking** - Manages changes to validators.
- **Governance** - Supports the one-vote-per-token voting and governance system for token holders.
- **IBC** - Inter-Blockchain Communication protocol that enables asset transfers across Cosmos blockchains.

In addition to using the predefined Cosmos modules, Terp Network employs custom modules for additional network features:

- **Feeshare** - This module shares contract execution fees with the smart contract developers, creating additional layers of potential revenue streams for teams & smart contract deployers.
- **Global Fee** - A module that sets a minimum fee across all transactions. 
- **IBChooks** - This module allows incoming token transfers to call a function on any smart contract.
- **Tokenfactory** - The tokenfactory module allows any account to create a new native denom. 

# Smart Contracts
The Terp Network protocol uses CosmWasm, WebAssembly (Wasm), Go, and Rust. Over 40 high-level programming languages support Wasm, including C and C++, TypeScript, Python, and Java.

# Economic Overview
With Terp Network, dapps can earn a portion of transaction fees in exchange for their contributions to the network.
This earning model is similar to how validators are rewarded for operating nodes in a typical Proof-of-Stake (PoS) chain.


Terp Network allows each dapp developer and their community to configure how rewards are managed and distributed. 
When a contract is instantiated, the dapp creator specifies an **owner** address where all fees and rewards are automatically deposited. 
This target address can be the creator's address, a multisig address, or an address that is controlled by a separate custom contract. Ownership can then be transferred to a new address as needed. Ownership transfer requires only the signature of the previous owner.

#### Inflation

The overall inflation rate on the Terp network follows the model of the <a href="https://github.com/gavinly/CosmosParametersWiki/blob/master/Mint.md" target="_blank">mint module</a> in the Cosmos Hub.

The Terp Network protocol then shares a portion of these total inflation rewards directly to the community pool.
These distribution values are configurable parameters that can be adjusted by the Terp Network community through network governance.

Inflationary rewards are paid out by the network on a per-block basis.

#### Smart Contract Fees

Smart contract platforms today charge network fees ("gas") based on the amount of computational processing required by on-chain transactions.
While this method of measurement works for the underlying economics of a network, it does not support use cases where a developer has to cover additional costs, such as distributed storage, access to off-chain processing, external data sources, or other premium features such as audited and insured contracts.
