title: Introduction to DAO's & SubDAO's

As part of our ongoing efforts to build a robust and experiened coorporative network of peers, we are preparing to instantiate two new sub-DAOs, alongside our main TestNET DAO.

## What is a DAO & SubDAO?
At its simplest, a DAO is an organization where you can vote on proposals. Proposals are written to an immutable, public ledger (blockchain) - their text, whether they passed or failed, and who voted on them. Proposals can be natural language rules or laws (for example, you could run a legislature with them), or they can be software.

The DAO's governance can itself be modified by governance proposals. For example, the voting rules of the DAO themselves (e.g., how long voting periods last, what proportion of people need to vote on something for it to pass, etc.) can be modified by governance proposals.
