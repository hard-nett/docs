Introduction to Terp Network DAO's

### A - TerpNET TestNET DAO
The TerpNET TestNET DAO was instantiated by the governance of our test network and involves two participants, @xiti and @returniflost. This DAO serves as the backbone of our testing efforts.
### B - Genesis-Prep Sub-DAO
Instantiated by the TestNET-DAO, the Genesis-Prep Sub-DAO serves a crucial role in our preparations for mainnet launch. It serves to hold consensus of items discussed and decided upon in the lead up to mainnet, having a chance to test inital parameters for a smooth transition to a fully operational network.
### C - Scavenger-Hunt Sub-DAO
Finally, the Scavenger-Hunt Sub-DAO was instantiated by the TestNET DAO and serves to verify participation within the Terp Network Test Nets. By participating in scavenger hunts, members can demonstrate their involvement and commitment to the development of our network.
