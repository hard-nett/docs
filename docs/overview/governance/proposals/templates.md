# Standardized Proposal Templates
The Terp Network Governance Framework allows for various different types of proposals, both on-chain and off-chain. This section serves as a basic guide for the necessary components of proposals. Depending on the proposal type, certain components may be required. Use this table as a reference sheet for which of the following components are required for your type. 

## A. Universal Components
All proposals must include the following **Proposal Components**. 
___
**Title** - Short and sweet, with the [correct tags](/governance/proposals/definitions#proposal-phase--identification-tags) prefixed.
**Author(s)** - List of authors and contributors involved in the writing of the proposal.
**Summary** - A brief, high-level summary of what changes are being suggested. Summary should be a single sentence, or a bulleted list.
**Abstract** - Abstract is a multi-sentence (short paragraph) technical summary. This should be a very terse and human-readable version of the motivation and specification sections. Someone should be able to read only the abstract to get the gist of what this specification does.
**Motivation** - The motivation section should describe the "why" of this proposal. What problem does it solve? What benefit does it provide to the Evmos network?
