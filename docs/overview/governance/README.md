# Terp Network Governance


## Truly Decentralized, Community Governed Network 

Like other Cosmos-based chains, Terp Network utilizes `on-chain governance` for all protocol level executions of proposals via the `gov` module included in the CosmosSDK. This gives the community [full control of the network](./parameters), including complex parameter changes, distribution changes, treasury pool spending, and even upgrades on the netowrk. Anyone who holds or stakes TERP can participate in these votes, regardless of the voter's validator choices. Immense power is given to the community to govern and dictate the future of the chain. 

## Limitations & Shortcomings
While the governance module in Cosmos SDK is sufficient for on-chain governance, there are limitations and shortcomings of the module that make it difficult to conduct off-chain governance - a crucial component for a DAO to be able to operate efficiently. These limitations are being faced head on, with based projects like [DAO DAO](https://daodao.zone), [Wrappr](https://wrappr.wtf), and others.  We hope to bridge the growing gap in innovations and tools between Cannabis Culture and the Interchain with the deployment of interoperable goverance tools onto our SDK, opening up a new world of tools for IBC chains.
