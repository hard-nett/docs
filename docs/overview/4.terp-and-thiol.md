## `$TERP`

*The $TERP token is a governance token that is how delegators decide the future of the protocol, including **every implementation detail**.*

$TERP will initially be used for the following (although governance is free to add or remove these functions):

- Use in IBC supported ecosystems
- Use in smart contract messages 
- Voting on governance proposals 
- Vest to another address 
- Send to another address
- Use to create new token via token-factory module


## `$THIOL`

The $Thiol token is a reward to validators actively participating in consensus of each newly minted block. The amount of $THIOL minted each year decreases. 


$THIOL will initially be used for the following (although governance is free to add or remove these functions):

- Pay for on-chain fees
- Fee-grant to another address
- Native token in IBC ecosystems
- Native token in smart contracts

These tokens are your personal stash to interact with Terp Network.
