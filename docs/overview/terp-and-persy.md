# TERP-&-PERSY

## Terp

The $TERP token is a governance token that allows staked token holders to decide the future of the protocol, including **every implementation detail**. $TERP will initially be used for the following (although governance is free to add or remove these functions):

- Voting on protocol upgrades
- Allocating liquidity mining rewards for bonded liquidity gauges
- Setting the base network swap fee

Governance is the critical component of how Terp Network evolves. Active stakeholders of the network will be responsible for proposing, vetting, and passing protocol upgrades.

## Persy

The $Persy token is what is rewarded to validators actively participating in consensus of each newly minted block. The amount of $PERSY minted each year decreases, with a Maximum supply of 1 Billion Tokens.

These tokens are your personal stash to interact with Terp Network. 

### Foundational Grants

In order to fuel the growth of Terp Network, teams are encouraged to contact contributors to set up a fee-grant structure for their application. This will be epoch based, & can help bootstrap user interaction intially.
