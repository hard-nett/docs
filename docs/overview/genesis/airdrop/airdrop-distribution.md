# Airdrop 
Checkout [this article](https://akash.network/blog/a-founders-guide-to-the-secs-safe-harbor-proposal-for-utility-tokens/) that describes a framework that puts true decentralized initiatives in a good position to bootstrap. 

The process of finding a fair airdrop method is based percentiles and normalization for each projects token holder map statistics included via consensus of various TestNET DAOs and subDAOs. This process involves the following steps:

## 0. Snapshot Holder Distributions
First, an export of holders from a community that is included is required. Thanks to blockchains, these are 100% verifiable, given the block height of the export.

## 1.  Percentile Distributions
To determine the distribution of project tokens to holders, each project token holders are mapped into percentile ranges. 

## 2. Points for Percentiles
Each percentile group is then allocated either 1, 2, or 3 points. It is possible to now identify large disparities in the amount of tokens held by each percentile group, which can be used to determine the allocation of points for similar percentile ranges.

## 3. Analyze Deltas in Holder Distributions 
Once each percentile group has been assigned a point value, the total amount of points allocated for each project can be calculated. We now are aware of the total number of holders eligible for each project, and the total points allocated to each project. 

## 4. Calculate TERP & THIOL Per Point  
This information can be used to normalize the amount of tokens (TERP and THIOL) that each project holder is eligible to receive, ensuring that the distribution is relative and fair.

## 5 . On-Chain Consensus
Governance is then used to verify general consensus of the distribution & allocation to new community members.

**Conclusion**
This process ensures that the decision-making process is transparent and verifiable.

**Airdrop Communities:**
The following token holders are proposed to be included in the genesis file

| Project Name  |  % of airdrop allocation  | piecewise range - min | piecewise range - max |   |
|---------|:----------------:|:------:|:-----------:|---|
| Bitcanna                       | 24%     | 1   |  100  |   
| Cosmos Hub Stakers             | 75%     | 1   |  100  | 
| OG's & Test-net Scavengers     | 1%      | 1   |  100  | 


## Vesting 
As Terp Network continues to progressively decentralize, there are many techniques and methods applied to minimize risk inherited with networks in their infancy. One of these techniques is vesting, which to encourage sustainability & long-term commitment, we will be using vesting plans on all of the genesis TERP tokens airdropped (not including the protocol owned treasury). You can learn more about the [standard Cosmos SDK vesting account](https://docs.cosmos.network/main/modules/auth/vesting). 

Tokens that are vesting will only be able to be used for delegating to validators for things like governance and earning rewards. a [Cliff Vesting](https://legalnodes.com/article/unpaid-token-distribution) structure will give us time to do things where having tokens in active circulation would not permit viable bootstrapping opportunities.
