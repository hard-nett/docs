```

## 2. Create New Forum Post in Discord
As we expect discussion to be able to occur naturally prior to a proposal, we want to create this governance requirements by having each participant create a new [blog post here](https://discord.gg/2NsAXhmG). The following is a template you can use:
```
Title - **TerpNET OG Challenge-1:** Add <your-moniker>
Description - <your-wallet-address> is requesting to be added to the terpNET og DAO 
```

## 3. Broadcast proposal 
Once discussion has been held, broadcast the proposal. It will need to be funded within 3 days of broadcasting to begin the voting period.

We can then generate it:
```
terpd tx gov submit-proposal --title "OG Challenge-1: Add <your-discord-alias> to TestNET subDAO --type text --description \
"This is a request to add myself <name>, <terp-address> ,<terpval-address(optional)>, \
<Jurisdiction/Country>, to participate in the TerpNET OG Challenge 1. The thing(s)  \ 
I am most excited for about Terp Network is(are) \
<insert-the-thing(s)-you-are-most-excited-about-Terp-Network?>." \  
--gas 2000000 --fees 2000000uthiolx --chain-id 90u-1 --from <your-wallet>

```
Alternatively, you can use this UI to broadcast your text based proposal [here](https://proposals.subtract.fi/draft?type=TextProposal&chain=terpnettestnet) ;)
```md
