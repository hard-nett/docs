*Get questions answered about workflow leading up to the airdrop, during the airdrop, and possibilities for after the airdrop of TERP & THIOL tokens.*

Welcome! Terp Network is preparing for another push for decentralizing direct ownership of the protocol.

### Hasn’t there already been an airdrop for Terp Network?

Yes! During the rollout of the network, the initial distribution of TERP & *(formerly named PERSY*) THIOL’s were vested to:
-  **$ATOM** holders, the staking token for Cosmos Network
-  **$BITCANNA** holders, the staking token for another cannabis focused blockchain project.
- **Testnet Scavengers** 
- **Testnet OG's**
- **TerpNET Foundation**

Along with the initial distribution, a governance proposal passed that approved an airdrop to a number of cannabis & web3 focused communities. This airdrop is currently active and available to be claimed through a smart contract deployed onto main-net of Terp Network. 

### Can my favorite cannabis web-3 project also be included in the Terp Network Headstash?

If you would like to see a cannabis & web3 project included in the airdrop, please reach out to the community! A governance proposal is required in order to make any decision on the included communities, and a snapshot export that can be verified of its authenticity is required. 

### When will the airdrop be able to be claimed?

There is no set timeline for the Secret Headstash Airdrop. There will be a proposal to set the claim window of the secret headstash airdrop for 2 years, where upon the end of this window, any unclaimed tokens will be clawed-backed and burned from the total supply.

### Is the airdrop going to appear in my Metamask wallet automatically?

The secret headstash airdrop will not appear in your wallet automatically — you will need to manually claim the TERP & THIOL from a wallet compatible with Terp Network (and the broader cosmos ecosystem), through the airdrop website.

### What wallet will I need for the airdrop?

There are a number of compatible wallets to claim your secret headstash airdrop. [Keplr](http://keplr.app) & [Leap](http://leapwallet.io) are two of the leading wallets for the cosmos. You can also use a cold-wallet such as Ledger. The Heastash claim will not be compaible with Metamask Snaps' feature.

### Where and when can I buy additional TERP & THIOL?

At the time of writing, there are no active liquidity pools for TERP or THIOL available. There are a number of viable paths in order to bootstrap liquidity, however open discussions with community members is still needed. 

### I want to test out claiming the airdrop. When can I do this?

A push to make public the testnet deployment of the secret headstash airdrop is underway & the priority of our contributors. Expect public announcements from all community channels as soon as this deployment is ready!

### What are the tokenomics of TERP & THIOL?

The tokenomics of Terp Network are of the dual-token model. TERP, the native staking token started with a total supply of `420,000,000`. There is no inflationary rewards for TERP tokens. THIOL’s are the native gas token of Terp Network. THIOL’s are spent during on-chain transactions, and are rewarded to TERP stakers, in the form of inflationary reward blocks. There were `420,000,000` THIOL tokens during the network genesis, and at the time of writing this, there are now `779,554,268` . More details about the initial tokenomics of Terp Network can be found [here](https://github.com/terpnetwork/genesis-prelaunch).

### Conclusion

Thank you to everyone involved in the Terp Network community. It has been over a year since Terp Networks existence, and the excitement around getting direct ownership into communities of web3 & cannabis has grown with each day; and now with privacy as the priority!
