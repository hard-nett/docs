## `$TERP`

The $TERP token is a governance token that allows staked token holders to decide the future of the protocol, including **every implementation detail**. $TERP will initially be used for the following (although governance is free to add or remove these functions):

- Voting on protocol upgrades

Governance is the critical component of how Terp Network evolves. Active stakeholders of the network will be responsible for proposing, vetting, and passing protocol upgrades.

## `$THIOL`

The $Thiol token is what is rewarded to validators actively participating in consensus of each newly minted block. The amount of $THIOL minted each year decreases. $THIOL will initially be used for the following (although governance is free to add or remove these functions):

- Pay for on-chain fees

These tokens are your personal stash to interact with Terp Network.
