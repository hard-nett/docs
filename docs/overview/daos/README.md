# DAOS

## Definition and Purpose
SubDaos are typically DAO-funded teams with a recurring budget with no termination date (i.e., Community Moderation & Support, Marketing & Creative Services, etc).

SubDaos are the sub-units of how Terp DAO advances its purpose. A subDao is a group of people actively working on tasks that align with Terp Networks Constitutional Values and community run initiatives. As such, ratifying subdaos sets boundaries on what is and isn't in scope for Terp Network DAO's governance.

## SubDao Requirements
Anyone may start a subdao and gather momentum behind it by posting on Commonwealth. Until a formal proposal for a budget is made, this subdao is considered “informal.” A subdao can be as broad or narrow as its initiators like, but subdao proposals must satisfy the following criteria:

- Have a clear objective that aligns with Terp Network' values and objectives as listed in the Constitution.
- Distinguish itself from or explicitly state its improvements on existing subdaos.
- The specific KPI that the sub-DAO will focus on driving success in
- The actual work that the sub-DAO will undertake to drive toward the KPI
- Propose clear budgets and timelines for producing outcomes and all in line with the budget proposal flow.

## SubDao Formation Process
SubDao can be formed through the Terp Network Proposal Framework. The proposal process can be read more in-depth here and the proposal must include the SubDao component template.

The burden falls mostly on the proposers of the sub-DAO, i.e., the sub-DAO must convince the Terp Network Community to fund its operations and support its mission. In other words, the sub-DAO should lobby for its formalization and funding proposal to pass.

A great way to build trust within the community is to operate informally first.

## SubDao Stages 
SubDaos have five potential states. Each of the five states and the requirements for a subdao in each state are outlined below:
- **Informal**: The subdao is not funded by the DAO, and has not made a formal proposal with its goals and a budgetary request.
- **Proposed**: The subdao has made a formal proposal to the DAO for a working budget.
- **Active**: The subdao is active and funded by the DAO.
- **Inactive**: The subdao has been discontinued and is no longer being funded by the DAO.
