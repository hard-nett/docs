# Introduction

The cannabis community is built on the principles of decentralization and diversity, where people from all walks of life can come together, learn from each other, and build lifelong connections. However, these values are being threatened, and it's important that we educate and raise awareness about the tools available to combat censorship.

That's where Terp Network comes in. We believe that blockchain technology and self-sovereignty can help ensure a fair and transparent cannabis industry.

## Industry Concerns

Our goal is to support growth, sustainability, and innovation in the cannabis market through verifiable software that is accessable to everyone. We know that there's a need for better tools and resources, and Terp Network is here to fill that gap.

## Mission Statement

At Terp Network, it mission is simple: to build a strong, supportive community that contributes to the success and sustainability of the cannabis industry through verifiable, decentralized, open source, permissionless, & censorship resistance software & education. We believe that by cooporating within a growing ecosystem, we can make a positive impact on this industry and the people it serves, which roots many other cultures both alike and independent from each other.


##  What is Terp Network?

TERPNET is a **decentralized platform** for the cannabis community to build applications and learn about the benefits of self-sovereign De-Fi tooling, in an hyperfocused ecosystem for our community. 


Powered by [Tendermint Core](https://tendermint.com/), [CosmosSDK](https://docs.cosmos.network/), & [CosmWasm](https://cosmwasm.com/), Terp Network is a verifiable interface for teams to create solutions for specific problems in the cannabis industry, utilizing the credibility & censorship resistance features offered by smart contracts and accuracy blockchains manifest.

## Use Cases
