# Introduction

The cannabis community is built on the principles of decentralization and diversity, where people from all walks of life can come together, learn from each other, and build lifelong connections. However, these values are being threatened, and it's important that we educate and raise awareness about the tools available to combat censorship.

That's where Terp Network comes in. We believe that blockchain technology and self-sovereignty can help ensure a fair and transparent cannabis industry.

## Industry Concerns

Our goal is to support growth, sustainability, and innovation in the cannabis market. We know that there's a need for better tools and resources, and Terp Network is here to fill that gap.

## Mission Statement

At Terp Network, it mission is simple: to build a strong, supportive community that contributes to the success and sustainability of the cannabis industry. We believe that by cooporating within a growing ecosystem, we can make a positive impact on this industry and the people it serves.


##  What is Terp Network?

TERPNET  is a **decentralized platform** for the cannabis community to build applications and learn about the benefits of self-sovereign De-Fi tooling. 

 Powered by [Tendermint Core](https://tendermint.com/), [CosmosSDK](https://docs.cosmos.network/), & [CosmWasm](https://cosmwasm.com/), Terp Networks becomes the interface for teams to create solutions for specific problems in the cannabis industry, utilizing the credibility offered by smart contracts on the blockchain.

## Use Cases 

- ### Smart Contracts 
With TERPNET, users can develop and deploy customized applications to meet their specific needs in a secure and fast Proof-of-Stake network. This opens up exciting possibilities for the cannabis community to find new and innovative solutions.

- ### Governance Capabilities
Governance on Terp Network is achieved through formal voting by the protocol's participants. This allows the community to make decisions and shape the direction of the platform, both on and off-chain. Decisions can be made through text-based proposals, protocol parameter changes, and binary upgrades.

### Cross Chain Interoperablity

The **Inter-blockchain Communication** *protocol* (**IBC**) is a reliable & secure interoperability protocol that handles reliable transport, authentication, and ordering of data across different sovereign blockchains.

IBC can be used by any application which builds on top of Cosmos SDK networks, for things like cross-chain asset transfers, multichain smart contracts, with more being developed daily. 

This is an exciting feature as **current projects focused on cannabis + web3 adoption are already interoperable with terp network.** If you are interested in providing real utility for your project, [**join our discord**](https://discord.gg/SYEjMwAac7) to find active community members!
