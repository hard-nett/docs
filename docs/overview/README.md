# Introduction

`The Cannabis community has largely been a decentralized space.`

This truth is what makes cannabis culture so diverse, giving those between other cultures a chance to experience & learn from each other, while building lifelong friendships & achieving goals in the process. This aspect of **decentralization is being attacked** from many vectors, & in order to combat this, education & awareness of the true values of these tools is needed. 

 *TERPNET is infrastructure that helps address these challenges, and we believe that **self-soviergty** via **blockchain technology** will play an integral role in achieving a part in surfacing intentions.*

## Industry Concerns

It is obvious that in the cannabis market that there is a urgent demand for tooling that gives us a better chance at 
- Growth
- Sustainability
- Innovation

## Mission Statement

*TERPNET's mission is to build this project on the **foundation of community.** We take on this initiative confident that TERPNET & those involved will contribute to the success of the cannabis industry and support its sustainable growth in a meaningful way. The industry itself is our motivation.*


##  What is TERPNET?

TERPNET is a **decentralized ledger** for cannabis culture to build applications & learn the values of self-soveirgn De-Fi tooling. 

 Powered by [Tendermint Core](https://tendermint.com/), [CosmosSDK](https://docs.cosmos.network/), & [CosmWasm](https://cosmwasm.com/), teams will be able to create solutions to cannabis specific problems, directly leveraging smart contracts & immutability blockchain transactions provide!

## Use Cases 

- ### Smart Contracts 
TERPNET is an exciting opportunity for teams to create solutions to cannabis-specific problems, directly leveraging smart contracts and the immutability blockchain transactions provide. Users can develop applications for their specific needs locally, & deploy useful features in a Proof-of-Stake network to handle fast transactions from person to person.

- ### Governance Capabilities
  Governance is decisions made as a whole via voting of each specific's protocols participants. Governance is coordinated formally both off & on-chain to vote & mold Terp-Net itself.

*What kind of changes are made via on-chain governance with Terp-Net?* 

    - Text Based Proposals
    - Protocol Parameter Changers
    - Binary Upgrades

### Cross Chain Interoperablity

The **Inter-blockchain Communication** *protocol* (**IBC**) is a reliable & secure interoperability protocol that handles reliable transport, authentication, and ordering of data across different sovereign blockchains.

IBC can be used by any application which builds on top of Cosmos SDK networks, for things like cross-chain asset transfers, multichain smart contracts, with more being developed daily. 

This is an exciting feature as **current projects focused on cannabis + web3 adoption are already interoperable with terp network.** If you are interested in providing real utility for your project, [**join our discord**](https://discord.gg/SYEjMwAac7) to find active community members!
