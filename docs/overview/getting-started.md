# Getting Started

Anyone can use interchain applications via Terp Network. If this is your first time learning about Terp Network, please take a look at the following introduction to concepts that should help you understand how to navigate and get started with Terp Network in a way that serves you best:

## What you will need 
- An internet connection 
- A Cryptocurrency wallet 

## Why do I need a cryptocurrency wallet?
Terp Network is compatible with a growing number of cryptocurrency wallets. These wallets are your Keys to EVERYTHING that you do on a blockchain. Whether it is to send tokens to grandma, or providing a unique cryptographic signature in a on chain buisness agreement, your cryptocurrency wallet allows you to manage these functions. 

This is why it is extremely important to take precautionary measures to keep your private keys extremely secure (the thing that gives you your access to your wallet)

If you are reading this, you are good to go! Anyone is able to broadcast messages (AKA transactions) through an internet connection to a node on Terp Network. This can happen via **[web applications](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_application)** that are built by community members, which route messages to an active node on the network, or even manually with the terp-cores CLI (command-line interface)
