# Validating On Mainnet
## When? 
`A proposal to establish the offical launch date coming soon :)`

## Housekeeping for Validators: Submitting a gentx for mainnet
1. You should have generated and secured the validator consensus key you are going to be validating under during mainnet.

2. Be prepared to sign a transaction under an address in the genesis file.

3. We will begin collecting Gentxs for mainnet once the recommended genesis allocations are published.
