# Superfluid Staking

## Abstract

Superfluid Staking provides the consensus layer more security with a
sort of "Proof of Useful Stake". Each person gets an amount of Osmo
representative of the value of their share of liquidity pool tokens
staked and delegated to validators, resulting in the security guarantee
of the consensus layer to also be based on GAMM LP shares. The OSMO
token is minted and burned in the context of Superfluid Staking.
Throughout all of this, OSMO's supply is preserved in queries to the
bank module.
