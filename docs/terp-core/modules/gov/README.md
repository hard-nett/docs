# Gov

The ```gov``` module enables on-chain governance which allows Terp token holders to participate in a community led decision-making process. For example, users can:

- Form an idea and seek feedback
- Create a proposal and adjust according to feedback as needed
- Submit a proposal along with an initial deposit
- Deposit tokens and fund an active proposal
- Vote for an active proposal
