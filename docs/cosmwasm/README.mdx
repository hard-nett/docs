# CosmWasm - Smart Contracts

## What is cosmwasm?

CosmWasm is a smart contract platform written as a module that can be integrated into any blockchain built on top of the [Cosmos SDK](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk). In simple terms, it is the Cosmos (Cosm) way of utilizing WebAssembly (Wasm), hence its name.

[Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) is currently the most widely used programming language for CosmWasm. In the future, other programming languages, such as Go, may also be utilized. Read CosmWasmâ€™s launch article [here](https://blog.cosmos.network/announcing-the-launch-of-cosmwasm-cc426ab88e12).
