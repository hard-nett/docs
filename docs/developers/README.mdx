Building on Terp Network means building applications that come with certainties in their functions. With the proper configuration, these applications are not subject to many traditional censorship methods seen inside existing applications, services, and platforms.

  # The Terp Stack: what apps are built of

  Below defines a framework for what is involved in an application on Terp Network. Please note this is a simplified example, and can vary in complexity given the specific use-case:

  ## Smart Contract
  Smart contracts are the code that performs all of the logic that one would want to be verified. Essentially the more mission-critical functions, these are a great way to bring more trust in scenarios where it may be needed, such as escrow payments, loans, etc.

  These will have functions that public, meaning that transactions calling smart contracts can be created , signed, and broadcasted to the network in ways useful to bringing patrons a great experience.

  ## User Interface 
User interfaces are the fun buttons, images, layouts, and components that are used by most to interact with smart contracts. These UI's contain logic that can have query clients and interfaces specific to the smart contracts that power whatever the UI features is.


  ## Caching Indexer
  Not can the UI have logic to query data directly from the blockchain, an indexer that keeps specific data that may be frequently used, can also have a query client routed to a UI, futher improving things that impact how the app feels, specifically loading times or large content.

  ## Additional Web Services
Additional web services such as notifactions, load-balancers, automation-scripts and more can make life easier as a team curating their own application.
