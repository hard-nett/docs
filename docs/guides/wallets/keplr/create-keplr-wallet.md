Once youâ€™ve installed Keplr wallet, youâ€™ll see four options to set up an account:

- Creating a new account via setting up new seed/mnemonic phrase
- importing an existing seed phrase account,
- importing your Ledger account, or
- creating a new account via Google One-Click Login

:::warning 
ðŸš« PLEASE NOTE: NO TEAM should ever need to reach out and ask you to validate your mnemonics. Be careful of scammers.

## 1. Create a New Account via Secret Seed/mnemonic Phrase

:::info 
NOTE: A seed phrase or mnemonic phrase is a string of 12 or 24 words combined to form your master account key. Only you will be given the key, and whoever holds the key will have permanent access to the wallet. Keep your seed phrase safe!
:::

1. To create a seed phrase account, choose option `[Create new account]`.
2. The next page shows you your secret seed/mnemonic phrase. You can select a 12 or 24 words phrase. **Save this phrase in a secure place but also do not lose it.** *(You'll need to input this phrase into the following page.) *
3. Next, enter a name for your account and password (you can change these later). Click on `[Next]`.
4. To confirm the creation of this new account, you'll need to click on the words in the right order in which they appear in your seed/mnemonic phrase. Press `[Register]` and you're all set. 

## 2. Import an Existing Account via Mnemonic Phrase

1. Click on `[Import existing account]`
2. Select Mnemonic seed phrase (12 or 24 words) or Private key from the dropdown and enter in the appropriate slot. Take care to check that they are spelled correctly, typed in small letters and in correct order. Account name and a new password also need to be entered. 
3. Select `[Next]` and the reinstallation is complete.

## 3. Import/connect a Ledger Account
1. To begin importing your Ledger account, choose `[Import Ledger]`.
2. Set the account name for the Ledger account, then click `[Next]`.
3. Connect and unlock your Ledger hardware wallet, then open the Cosmos app. When you see â€˜Cosmos readyâ€™ on the screen, press â€˜Nextâ€™ on the popup. **Your browser may ask you to grant permission to access the hardware, so please make sure you approve.**
4. **And thatâ€™s it.** You can now start using your Ledger hardware wallet with any of the blockchains that Keplr supports.
