# create leap wallet

# Download Browser Extension
https://www.leapwallet.io/ is the official website for leap to download the wallet for Cosmos networks. In this case, we’re using the Brave browser, which means we’ll need to download the wallet extension.

## Create Brand New Wallet
Select “Create a new wallet” on the interface.

## Secure New Secret Recovery Phrase 
Next, hover over the secret recovery phrase and copy it to ensure you can store it somewhere safely *(preferably offline)*. **`Remember that losing the secret recovery phrase means you won’t have access to your wallet and the assets remaining inside it.`**

Once you’ve written down the phrase, select “I have it saved somewhere”.

Select a password of your choice, and make sure to write this down as well. If all goes correctly, your screen should look like the one in the image below.

### Open the Leap extension.

- `⌘`+`shift`+`k` on mac/linux
- `ctrl`+`shift`+`k` on windows
