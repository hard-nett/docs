CI stands for Continuous Integration, a software engineering practice where members of a team integrate their work frequently, usually through automated processes. In the context of Git, CI Workflows refer to the automated series of processes that are triggered by events in your Git repository, ensuring your code is built, tested, and validated continuously. This facilitates early detection and resolution of errors, improving the overall quality and reliability of your software.
