# Project Setup

1. [Create a new project](#creating-a-project)
2. [Build your code](#building)
3. [Request testnet Tokens](../../network/faucet.md)
4. [Transpile CosmWasm code binaries](#producing-wasm-executables)
5. [Deploy to a testnet](#deploying-your-contract-on-chain)
6. [Create transactions and query data from a deployed contract](#interacting-with-your-contract)
7. [Build a dapp frontend](#building-a-dapp-frontend)

## Creating a project

## Building

### Producing Wasm executables
*CosmWasm* **wasm** executables are optimized using the **cosmwasm/rust-optimizer** which produces a smaller executable size than **cargo wasm**.
```

```
The rust-optimizer will make sure that the WASM binary is as small as possible in order to minimize fees and blockchain storage.
:::info
To use the rust-optimizer you will need to have [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/) installed.
