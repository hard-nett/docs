# Preparing the Wasm bytecode for production

Before we upload it to a chain, we need to ensure the smallest output size possible,
as this will be included in the body of a transaction. We also want to have a
reproducible build process, so third parties can verify that the uploaded Wasm
code did indeed come from the claimed rust code.

To solve both these issues, we have produced `rust-optimizer`, a docker image to
produce an extremely small build output in a consistent manner. The suggest way
to run it is this:

```sh
docker run --rm -v "$(pwd)":/code \
  --mount type=volume,source="$(basename "$(pwd)")_cache",target=/target \
  --mount type=volume,source=registry_cache,target=/usr/local/cargo/registry \
  cosmwasm/optimizer:0.16.0
```

Or, If you're on an arm64 machine, you should use a docker image built with arm64.

```sh
docker run --rm -v "$(pwd)":/code \
  --mount type=volume,source="$(basename "$(pwd)")_cache",target=/target \
  --mount type=volume,source=registry_cache,target=/usr/local/cargo/registry \
  cosmwasm/optimizer-arm64:0.16.0
```
