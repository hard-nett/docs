# Command Schema

While the Wasm calls (`instantiate`, `execute`, `query`) accept JSON, this is not enough
information to use it. We need to expose the schema for the expected messages to the
clients. You can generate this schema by calling `cargo schema`, which will output
4 files in `./schema`, corresponding to the 3 message types the contract accepts,
as well as the internal `State`.

These files are in standard json-schema format, which should be usable by various
client side tools, either to auto-generate codecs, or just to validate incoming
json wrt. the defined schema.
