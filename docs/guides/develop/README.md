# develop

Building on Terp Network requires a general focus on the following:

- **Smart Contracts** - programmable functions that usually handle important functions, to guaruntee the results of actions that happen for your usecase.

- **User Interface Frameworks** - This is not required for interacting with smart contracts, however to improve the experience for yourself or others usecase, energy may want to be put in to configure a UI (user interface) that interacts with your custom smart contracts.

- **IBC Protocol Workflow** - builds a cross-chain systems in order to tap into liquidity, features, or collaborate with other communities.

- **Middleware & Indexer Services** - may help power & optimize various computational & redundant processes a UI needs, such as batch queries, & contract state retrieval.
