## **Introduction to Cryptography Concepts**  
Cryptography is the backbone of modern security, enabling trust in digital systems. Below are foundational concepts every learner should understand, as they specifically relate to Terp Network:

## **Key-Pairs**  
**What**: A key-pair consists of a **public key** (shared openly) and a **private key** (kept secret). These generally are either stored on hardware we own (phones, computer, cold-wallets), or on custodial hardware (companies server, "big-tech"). Keys are really the 'magicians secret' to cryptography.


#### **The Magic of Asymmetric Cryptography**
This powerful tool enables secure communication and digital signatures. But what does that really mean?

* **Purpose**: Allows two parties to communicate securely without ever sharing their secret key in the open.
* **How it Works**:
	+ **1. Encryption**: Imagine you want to send a secret message to your friend Bob. You use Bob's **public key** (which he shares openly) to lock your message. Only Bob's **private key** (kept super secret) can unlock it!
	+ **2. Signing**: Like signing your name, but digitally! You use your **private key** to "sign" a message, and others use your **public key** to verify it's really from you. 

#### **Real-Life Example: Alice and Bob's Secret Message**

1. Alice writes a message and locks it with Bob's public key.
2. She sends the locked message to Bob.
3. Bob uses his private key to unlock and read the message.

## **Elliptic Curves**  
 In cryptography, elliptic curves are defined by complex equations like:

$$ y^2 = x^3 + ax + b \quad \text{(mod } p\text{)} $$

Don't worry too much about the math; focus on what they do for us!

#### **The Superpower of Elliptic Curves**

* **Provide Efficient Security**: Through the **Elliptic Curve Discrete Logarithm Problem (ECDLP)**, which is really hard for computers to reverse, even with massive power.
 
* **How Keys are Made**:
	1. **Private Key**: Just a number.
	2. **Public Key**: Generated by "walking" the private key along the elliptic curve (via **scalar multiplication**).
<!-- - **Applications**: Used in Bitcoin (ECDSA), Ethereum, and TLS for secure key exchange.   -->

### Computationaly Hard 
<!-- todo: describe how these are computationally hard in a way that is easy to understand, and stimulates retention o -->

#### **Key-pairs** and **elliptic curves** enable secure identities and transactions, without requiring custodial ownership of the private keys.

## **Hashes**  
Hash functions are like super-powerful, one-way mixers. You put in any input (text, image, etc.), and out comes a fixed-size, unique string (like a fingerprint).

#### **The Awesome Properties of Hashes**

1. **Deterministic**: Same input always gives the same output.
2. **One-way**: Good luck reversing the output to find the original input!
3. **Collision-resistant**: Finding two different inputs with the same output hash is extremely hard.

#### **Hash in Action: "Hello" Transformed**

* Input: "Hello"
* SHA-256 Hash Output: `2cf24dba5fb0a30e26e83b2ac5b9e29e1b161e5c1fa7425e73043362938b9824`

#### **Why We Love Hashes**

* **Secure Password Storage**: Stores hashes of passwords, not the passwords themselves.
* **Data Integrity Checks**: Verify data hasn’t been tampered with by comparing hashes.
* **Blockchain Block Headers**: Used to uniquely identify blocks in chains like Bitcoin.

#### **Merkle Trees**  
Imagine a family tree, but instead of names, it's filled with hashes! Merkle Trees are hierarchical structures that helps us verify data quickly.

#### **Visual Example**
```
                  Root (Hash(A+B))
                     /          \
             Hash(A)       Hash(B+C)
             /   \             /   \
         Data A  Data B    Data C  Data D
```

#### **The Trees Structure**

* **Leaves**: The bottom layer, where each "leaf" is a hash of an individual piece of data (e.g., a message).
* **Branches**: Each parent node is a hash of its two children, all the way up...
* **Root**: The topmost hash, representing the entire dataset. This is the "summary" of your whole tree!

#### **The Superpower of Merkle Trees**

* **Efficient Verification**: Check a subset of data without downloading the entire dataset. How? By only verifying the path from the leaf to the root!
* **Real-World Use**: Blockchains use Merkle Trees to summarize all transactions in a block, making verification faster and more efficient.

## **Blockchains**  
A decentralized book (ledger) where once something is written, it can't be erased. It's a chain of "blocks," each linked via cryptographic hashes.

#### **Blockchain Structure Decoded**
* **Blocks**:
	+ **Transactions** (e.g., sending cryptocurrency).
	+ **Timestamp**.
	+ **Previous Block’s Hash** (the "chain" link).
* **Consensus Mechanisms**:
	+ **Proof of Work (PoW)** - Bitcoin's energy-intensive puzzle-solving.
	+ **Proof of Stake (PoS)** - Ethereum’s stake-based validation.

#### **Key Properties of Blockchains**

1. **Immutability**: Changing a block would require altering all subsequent blocks, making tampering practically impossible.
2. **Transparency**: The entire ledger is open for all participants to audit.

### **Why These Concepts Matter Together**  

- **Hashes** and **Merkle trees** ensure data integrity and efficiency.  
- **Blockchains** combine these tools to create trustless, decentralized systems.  

This foundation allows anyone to understand how modern crypto systems secure value, data, and trust in the digital world.
