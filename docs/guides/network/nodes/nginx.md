To create an endpoint that others may use, we will want to configure our nodes into a setup which optimizes your endpoints UX, reliability & security. For this tutorial, we start from a basic Ubuntu server. 

## Requirements
This guide shows how to setup a node with custom HTTPS endpoints via Nginx, Certbot, and Cloudflare. 

## Installation

### 1.  Install nginx & certbot
```sh
sudo apt install nginx certbot python3-certbot-nginx
```

### 2. Setup nginx linked files

remove default nginx file
```sh
sudo rm -rf /etc/nginx/sites-available/default /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default
```

setup nginx file for rpc/api
```sh
sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/<your-endpoint-dns>
```

:::info
A template for the nginx configuration can be found [here](https://github.com/permissionlessweb/o-line-playbook/blob/main/nginx/sites-available/rpc-api-grpc-peer).
:::

link `sites-available` to `sites-enabled` 
```sh 
sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/<your-endpoint-dns> /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
```

test configuration is good to go
```
sudo nginx -t 
```

restart nginx service
```
sudo systemctl restart nginx
```

### 3. Request SSL Certificates 

A quick & temporary way to setup ssl certificates is through Letâ€™s Encrypt. To setup certificates for your endpoint, you will need to have pointed your DNS endpoints to your nodes ip address. 

Here, we setup certificates for RPC & API endpoints

```sh
sudo certbot --nginx -d <your-rpc-prefix>.<your-endpoint-dns> -d <your-api-prefix>.<your-endpoint-dns>
```


:::warning
note that this is just one example of how configuring a node with dns may be applied. Please do further research before deciding which method works best for you.
