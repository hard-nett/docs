## Query Governance Params

```sh

```

*Often times its useful to reference this endpoint for the proposal deposit params.*

## Draft Proposal

```sh
terpd tx gov draft-proposal 
```

this prints two files, `draft_metadata.json` & `draft_proposal.json`.

## Submit Proposal

```sh
terpd tx gov submit-proposal
```
