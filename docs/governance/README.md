# Terp Network Governance


## Truly Decentralized, Community Governed Network 

Like other Cosmos-based chains, utilized `on-chain governance` for all protocol level executions of proposals via the `gov` module included in the CosmosSDK. This gives the community [full control of the network](./parameters), including complex parameter changes, distribution changes, treasury pool spending, and even upgrades on the netowrk. Anyone who holds or stakes TERP can participate in these votes, regardless of the voter's validator choices. Immense power is given to the community to govern and dictate the future of the chain.
