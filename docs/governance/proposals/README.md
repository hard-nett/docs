# Proposals Framework

## Terp Community Proposals (TCPs)

TCPs are standardized proposals (not transmission control ;;) ) subject to voting that, once enacted regulate and define the behavior of the Terp DAO Governance system, and provides a funding mechanism for special projects and workstreams.

## The Terp Community Proposal Framework 
The Terp Community Proposal (TCP) Framework provides guidance for all future TCPs, and the first TCP is essential in creating templates, processes, and guidelines for working within the framework. It also identifies the necessary roles for implementing and enforcing the TCP process. In summary, this TCP establishes the foundation for the TCP framework
