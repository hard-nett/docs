# Fairdrop

We have seen the drama on some chains when dealing with the consequences of gamed airdrops,

We are doing our best to make this distribution "fair". Not just by releasing ~30% of tokens to various communities but also in how we select the participants. 

## Goals of Airdrop

Cosmos has many chains and many active contributors in many different forms. We wish to invite as many of them as possible to participate in the birth of the TERP-DAO. We have looked at many other airdrops and are doing our best to learn from their successes and failures. One notable item is to avoid people looking to "game the system" and quicky dump any airdropped tokens. For this reason, all airdropped tokens will be vesting, meaning that the can be used for voting and staking from day one, but it will take a full year until they can all be freely transferred and sold.

## Recipients 

Holders of CGAS, Test Network participants, & selected hodlers of cannabis & de-fi projects are included in the inital recipients.

CGAS was the inflationary token rewarded to holders of Chronic Token (V1), those who have ownership of cgas tokens either held CHT on Ethereum at a specific snapshot height, Were staking CHT on Chronic Network, or were previously Validators on Chronic Network. 

Test Network participants include those who are active & contributing in various ways. Details on the test net scavenger hunt can be found [here](https://github.com/terpnetwork/scavenger-hunt)

We will reserve some airdrop tokens to perform a second round that includes those who own other projects tokens (fungible & non-fungible) that focus on benefitting the fusion of cannabis & web-3 for their communities.

## Distribution Details

- CGAS Depositors
- Test-Net Contributors
- 3rd Party Cannabis x De-fi projects

## Timing 

Sept 27th will be the cut-off date for CGAS Depositors. This will give our contributors time to ensure this process was not gamed, & also lets those running infrastructure migrate resources to the new test network. 

If you manage your keys with a unique solution, we cannot provide support except to show how to import your mnemonic into another solution.
