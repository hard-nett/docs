# TERP-&-PERSY

## Purpose

The $TERP token is a governance token that allows staked token holders to decide the future of the protocol, including every implementation detail. $TERP will initially be used for the following (although governance is free to add or remove these functions):

- Voting on protocol upgrades
- Allocating liquidity mining rewards for bonded liquidity gauges
- Setting the base network swap fee

Governance is the critical component of how Terp Network evolves. Active stakeholders of the network will be responsible for proposing, vetting, and passing protocol upgrades.
