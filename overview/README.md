# Introduction

`The Cannabis community has largely been a decentralized space.`

This truth is what makes cannabis culture so diverse, giving those between other cultures a chance to experience & learn from each other, while building lifelong friedships & achieving goals in the process. This aspect of **decentralization is being attacked** from many vectors, & in order to combat this, education & awareness of the true values of these tools is needed. 

 *TERPNET is infrastructure that helps address these challenges, and we believe that **self-soviergty** via **blockchain technology** will play an integral role in achieving a part in surfacing intentions.*

## Industry Concerns

It is obvious that in the cannabis market that there is a urgent demand for tooling that gives us a better chance at 
- Growth
- Sustainability
- Innovatioin

## Mission Statement

*TERPNET's mission is to build this project on the **foundation of community.** We take on this initiative confident that TERPNET & those involved will contribute to the success of the cannabis industry and support its sustainable growth in a meaningful way. The industry itself is our motivation.*


##  What is TERPNET?

TERPNET is a interoperable hub for cannabis culture to embody & learn the values of self-soveirgn DeFi tooling. 

 Powered by CosmWasm, eams will be able to create solutions to cannabis specific problems, directly leveraging smart contracts & immutability blockchain transactions provide!

## Uses Cases 

- ### Smart Contracts 
TERPNET is an exciting opportunity for teams to create solutions to cannabis-specific problems, directly leveraging smart contracts and the immutability blockchain transactions provide. Users can develop applications for their specific needs locally, & deploy useful features in a Proof-of-Stake network to handle fast transactions from person to person.

- ### Governance Capabilities
  Governance is decisions made as a whole via voting of each specific's protocols participants. Governance is coordinated formally both off & on-chain to vote & mold TERPNET itself.

*What kind of changes are made via on-chain governance with TERPNET?* 

    - Text Based Proposals
    - Protocol Parameter Changers
    - Binary Upgrades

### Cross Chain Interoperablity

TBD.
