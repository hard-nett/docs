# Command Line Interface - TERPD


TERPD CLI is a tool that powers interacting seamlessly with the Terp Network. Terpd has a wide array of operations, from sending transactions to querying the blockchain's state and more.

TERPD CLI is not strictly limited to those running their own nodes. You can engage with the network even without hosting a node personally. You can utilize TERPD CLI to submit transactions or probe the network's state via RPC. This opens up opportunities to interact with the Terp Network blockchain, making it a versatile tool for a range of operations.

## Installation

You can download the latest release of the pre-built binary from the <a href='https://github.com/terpnetwork/terp-core/releases' target='_blank'>releases page</a>.


and you can compare that the sha256 hash strings match, By doing so, you are ensuring that the downloaded file matches the actual release file.

## Scope

The full scope of **terpd** commands can be viewed using the command **terpd --help**:

There are multiple ways to use Terp-Core with Docker. If you want to run Terp-Core inside a Docker setup and possibly connect the Docker container to other containerized compatible blockchain binaries, check out the guide on building a Docker image containing the Terp binary. If you instead want to generate a binary for use outside of Docker, but want to ensure the correct dependencies are used by building the binary inside a Docker container, then go ahead to the section on building the Terp-Core binary with Docker.

## Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- [Go](https://go.dev/doc/install)
- Strangelove's [Heighliner](https://github.com/strangelove-ventures/heighliner)

## General Setup

In order to build Terp-Core binaries with Heighliner, it is necessary to

- Have go installed.
- Clone the heighliner repository to your local machine (e.g. `git clone https://github.com/strangelove-ventures/heighliner`)
- Checkout the commit, branch, or release tag you want to build for Terp Network  (e.g. `terpnetwork/barberry`)

## Building A Docker Image

### Install Heighliner

```
go download
```

### Build a docker image & save it locally

```
./heighliner build -c terpnetwork --git-ref v5.1.0
```

This will create an image with the name `terpnetwork/terp-core` and the version tag `v5.1.0`. Now it is possible to run the `terpd` binary in the container, e.g. evaluating its version:

```
docker run -it --rm terpnetwork/terp-core:v5.1.0 terpd version
```

## Nice

Now that you have built the terp-core binary, either for local use or in a Docker container, you'll find information to run a node instance in the following section on setting up a local network.
